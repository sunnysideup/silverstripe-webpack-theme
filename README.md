# Base SilverStripe theme with a webpack build system

## Installation
Install this to your themes folder and install sswebpack_base to the themes folder.
Add a sswebpack_mysite folder with a src/main.js as the base and use imports inside there to add sass files "import './sass/style.sass'"
You can access the base theme files by using "@import '~base/sass/{file}'" inside a sass file.

sswebpack_mysite/src/main.js is the root of all includes

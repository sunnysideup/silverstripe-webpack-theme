# Base SilverStripe theme with a webpack build system

## Installation

 # Install this to your themes folder as sswebpack
 # Add a `themes/sswebpack_mysite` folder with  `themes/sswebpack_mysite/src/main.js` as the central file.
 # Use import statements inside this file to add other files -e.g. `import './sass/style.sass'`
 # You can access `themes/sswebpack_base` (or any other directories relating to your theme) by using `@import '~base/sass/{file}'`, however `sswebpack_mysite/src/main.js` remains the root of all includes
 # Add a `themes/ssbwebpack_dist` for the final output.

In theory you can change the name of the theme to something else.
